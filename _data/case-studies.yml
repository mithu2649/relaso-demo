Relaso was used to manage the calls and route them appropriately. Relaso Call Center Software popped up with caller details of prior interactions when a call came in. It also provided a way to fill in missing Contact details and take notes on caller requirements and tagged for easy classification and analysis later. The call record was stored for random quality checks later. Potential customers could also SMS to Relaso managed numbers. On average around 2 SMS per second came from that number. The SMS along with contact details and other information provided are captured in Relaso CRM. The Call Center Team uses the leads captured to make outbound calls. The details of conversation as well as the notes taken are stored in Relaso CRM as before. Keya Seth also used the mobile number to organize competitions at festival outlets like Durga Puja. Visitors to the stall will send SMS along with asked for details like name, answer etc. to the designated number which is then captured in our CRM and used to choose random winners.
