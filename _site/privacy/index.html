<h2 id="summary-of-our-privacy-policy">Summary of our Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Relaso Sales CRM respects your need for online privacy and protects any Personal Information that you may share with us, in an appropriate manner. Our practice with regards the use of your Personal Information is as set forth below in this Privacy Policy Statement. As a condition to use Relaso Services, you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy Statement as it may be updated from time to time. In the event of a material change, we shall notify you via email or by means of a prominent notice on the website. This Privacy Policy Statement applies exclusively to www.relaso.com. It covers every Relaso website that links here, and all of the products and services on those websites. The detailed policy follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Our privacy commitment</strong>: Relaso has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, or made money by showing you other people’s ads, and we never will. This policy tells you what information we collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it. Cookie Data collection: When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got into this site, from where you navigated here, and what features and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.</li>
  <li><strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection</strong>: Our products and services are not directed to individuals under 16. Relaso does not knowingly collect personal information from children who are under 16 years of age for its own purposes. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you believe that a child under 16 years has provided personal information to us, please write to <a href="mailto:support@relaso.com.">support@relaso.com</a> with the details, and we will take the necessary steps to delete the information we hold about that child. However, using our products, you can collect information about individuals who may be children. If you process information in relation with the child, you acknowledge and agree that you will be responsible for complying with the applicable laws and regulations related to the protection of such personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personal-information">Personal Information</h2>

<p>We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of them are information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we don’t store payment information like credit card numbers, bank account details etc. (except with your permission and in one of our secure payment gateways).</p>

<p>During the Registration Process for creating a user account, we request for your name and email address. You will also be asked to choose a unique username and password, which will be used solely for the purpose of providing access to your user account. Your name and email address will be used to inform you regarding new services, releases, upcoming events and changes in this Privacy Policy Statement. When you chooe to sign up for a user account, you also have the option to create the user account using any of the trusted third-party user authentication services integrated with Relaso Services. In doing so, no Personal Information within your third-party email accounts is transferred to your user account without your explicit consent.</p>

<p>Relaso will have access to third-party personal information provided by you as part of using Relaso Services such as contacts in your Relaso Mail account. This information may include third-party names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses and will be used for servicing your requirements as expressed by you to Relaso and solely as part and parcel of your use of Relaso Services. We do not share this third-party personal information with anyone for promotional purposes, nor do we utilize it for any purposes not expressly consented to by you.

<h2 id="call-log-permissions">Call log permissions</h2>

<p>Relaso Connect, our mobile application, offers the “Send client call details” feature to streamline client communication and task management. To utilize this feature, we require access to your call logs. However, we emphasize:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Limited access:</strong> We only access information regarding calls placed to or received from clients within your contact list.</li>
  <li><strong>Specificity:</strong> We solely utilize phone number, call duration, and call type (incoming/outgoing/missed/declined) - the content of your calls remains entirely private.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> We are committed to protecting your data and ensure that none of your call details are shared with third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granting or denying call log permissions is entirely at your discretion. You can manage this through the app settings and continue using Relaso Connect irrespective of your choice.</p>

<p>You can choose to grant or deny call log permissions within the app settings and continue to use our app without this feature.</p>

We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.</p>

<p>We’re required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, either we have your consent or we may need the information to provide the service you’ve requested from us. When that’s not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.</p>

<p>You can decline the use of certain kinds of information either not providing the information in the first place or opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable non-essential and intrusive third-party cookies from all Relaso websites and products.</p>

<p>We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it.
